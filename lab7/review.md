Who reviewed my code: Darren Liang, Matthew Barron
Who I reviewed: Darren Liang, Emily Fang

Both of my partners mentioned that I should comment my code more often. I agreed as it can allow others looking at my code to see my thought process. Itâ€™s also good for revisiting past code that you may not remember much about. Another thing I agreed with was that I should try to keep my code concise.

I reviewed Emily Fang and Darren Liang. There was generally no problems with their code at all. All of there syntax was fine, they had the required functions, and the code test well. For both of them they should comment a bit more and for Darren he needs more test cases to verify the code.
